### What is the ShopDev Alliance?

The ShopDev Alliance (SDA) is a professional collective built on a simple but powerful idea: even the best experts are stronger together. It is a global network of highly experienced, independent Shopify developers, designers, and consultants who collaborate to solve complex challenges, share cutting-edge knowledge, and push the boundaries of what's possible on the Shopify platform.

Membership is selective, ensuring that every individual in the Alliance has a proven track record of success and a deep commitment to their craft. Think of it not as a simple group, but as a dedicated brain trust for high-level e-commerce strategy and execution.
