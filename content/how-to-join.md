# How to Join the ShopDev Alliance

The ShopDev Alliance (SDA) is a private community for experienced Shopify developers who are dedicated to their craft and to helping each other grow. Our goal is to create a supportive and collaborative environment where members can share knowledge, solve problems, and build lasting relationships.

## Membership Criteria

To ensure a high-quality community, we have a few membership criteria. We are looking for developers who are:

*   **Experienced:** You should have a proven track record of working with Shopify. This isn't a community for beginners, but for seasoned professionals.
*   **Vouched For:** Our community is built on trust. We require a referral from an existing member who can speak to your character and work ethic.
*   **Community-Minded:** You should be willing to contribute to the community by sharing your knowledge, participating in discussions, and helping other members.

## How to Join

The primary way to join the ShopDev Alliance is by referral from a current member.

### The Referral Process

If you know a member of the SDA, hereâ€™s how the referral process works:

1.  **Get Referred:** Ask a current member to refer you. They will share a referral link with you.
2.  **Submit Your Application:** Fill out the application form, making sure to mention who referred you.
3.  **Review Process:** Your application will be reviewed by the SDA founding members. This process typically takes about one week.
4.  **Invitation:** If your application is approved, you will receive an email invitation to join the community. Your referrer will also be notified.

### Exceptions to the Referral Rule

We understand that not all qualified developers will have a direct connection to a current member. Therefore, we offer a path to membership for individuals who have demonstrated exceptional skill and leadership within the Shopify community.

You are automatically eligible to apply for membership if you meet either of the following criteria:

*   **Shopify Build Award Winner:** You have received a Shopify Build Award for your work.
*   **Shopify Community Leader:** You have earned the "Leader" badge in the official [Shopify Developer Community](https://community.shopify.dev/).

If you meet one of these criteria, please reach out to us, and we will guide you through the application process.
